# Sharingan - Infinite Tsukuyomi - [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/9641/) - [Modio](https://mod.io/g/blade-and-sorcery/m/sharingan-infinite-tsukuyomi) 
Spell Mod that allows you to make ALL AI brain dead forever.

This project is a fucking mess, I ported over some of the code from the other Sharingan version but never got around to even attempting to compile it, let alone test it. Not made for 1.0, especially the JSONs

When I tested this on Quest it crashed galore, good luck lol
If you do want to make it work on Quest, make sure you uncomment the Quest verion of "public static string folder" and comment out the PC line
